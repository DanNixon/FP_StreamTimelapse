FP_StreamTimelapse
==================

Timelapse recorder for BubbleScope with MJPEG streaming to run on the RasPi.

Requirements
------------

1.  OpenCV (tested with 2.4)
2.  RaspiStill
3.  cmake


Notes
----

In case of power failure the script should restart timelapse capture from the last image saved (with possible corruption of one original image and 0-5 equi images).

If the script cannot start it will take a copy of the images and log files, clean the directory and recompile the capture program (note in this case image numbering will not be continuous).

A log is created by the cron job (cron_tl.log) which details starting components and will show if the timelapse has failed to start.

A second log (screenlog.n) is generated by screen and shows output from the capure application and mjpg-streamer.
