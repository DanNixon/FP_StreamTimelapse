FP_StreamTimelapse
==================

Timelapse recorder for BubbleScope with MJPEG streaming to run on the RasPi.

Installation/Usage
==================

1) Clone repo onto Pi
2) Set path to folder in start_timelapse.sh, stop_timelaspe.sh and recovery.sh
3) Optionally set crontab to launch on boot
4) Options for configuring camera settings are in streaming_timelapse/main/cpp
5) Options for configuring timelaspe timing are in start_timelapse.sh

Notes
=====

In case of power failure the script should restart timelapse capture from the last image saved (with possible corruption of one original image and 0-5 equi images).

If the script cannot start it will take a copy of the images and log files, clean the directory and recompile the capture program (note in this case image numbering will not be continuous).

A log is created by the cron job (cron_tl.log) which details starting components and will show if the timelapse has failed to start.

A second log (screenlog.n) is generated by screen and shows output from the capure application and mjpg-streamer.
