Usage
=====

Note: assuming SSH access opposed to local terminal.

If capture is configured to start on boot type ```sudo reboot``` to reboot the Pi in order to start capture, otherwise execute ```start_timelapse.sh``` to start capture.

If after around 3 the light on the RasPI camera module is lit then capture has successfully started. In both cases capture can be stopped by executing ```stop_timelapse.sh```.

In case of power failure the script should restart timelapse capture from the last image saved (with possible corruption of one original image and 0-5 equi images).

If the Pi fails to start capture (usually after power failure) then it will attempt to perform auto recovery, in this process it will execute ```recovery.sh```, cleaning the directory of images and logfiles (by moving them to an archive folder, "recoveryN") and rebuilding the capture application.

A log (screenlog.0) is generated by screen and shows output from the capure application and mjpg-streamer.

If launched using cron, a log (cron_tl.log) will be created which details starting components and will show if the timelapse has failed to start.

Exporting a timelapse
---------------------

Both the raw images captured by the camera and the equi. images are stored in the tl_images folder, from here they can be copied from the Pi either using SFTP or by mounting the SD card on a desktop.

The ```tl_gen``` script can then be used to create a timelapse video of these images, a sample command would be the following: ```./tl_gen.sh ./equi/[filename].jpg ./[vid_out].mp4```, where [filename] is the filename given in the config stage and [vid_out] is the name of the resulting MP4 video file.

Streaming
---------

A stream of the raw camera captures is available at http://[pi_ip]:8080/?action=stream

The BPStreamViewer application can be used to view this stream, both unwrapped and on a sphere.

Notes
-----

The Pi has no in built RTC, hence system time is dependant on a reply from an NTP server, this may not always be possible, hence if getting a correct time for each image is important use the GPS EXIF data rather than ```EXIF.Image.DateTime```.

GPS time will also be more accurate, direct connection to a GPS device is Stratum 0 whereas NTP is at best Stratum 1.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Use either ```ps aux | grep stream``` or ```screen -ls``` to check status of capture, ~5 processes should be shown with ps and two screens should be shown with screen.

From the root folder (stream_tl) use ```tail -f screenlog.0``` to monitor capture in real time.

The command ```df -k``` can be used to monitor the amount  of free space remaining on the SD card.
